### 5 Principles

1. Focus on language **content** that is relevant to you.
1. Use your language as a **tool** to communicate right from day one as a kid does.
1. **Comprehensible** input. 
1. **Speak**. Do physiological training.
1. Psycho-physiological state. Be **relaxed**, be happy.

### 7 Actions

1. Listen, a lot.
1. Get the meaning first, even before you get the words.
1. Start mixing. It doesn't have to be perfect, just has to work.
1. Start with your tool box.
    - Week 1: try to say things in your target language:
        - "How do you say that?"
        - "I don't understand"
        - "repeat that please"
        - "what does that mean?"
    - Week 2: use simple pronouns, simple nouns, simple verbs, simple adjectives, communicating like a baby.
        - "me", "this", "you", "that"
        - "give", "hot"
    - Week 3/4: use **glue words** that tie bits of a language together, these logical transformers allow you to make more complex meaning.
        - "Although", "but", "therefore"
1. Get yourself a language parent. Four rules of a language parent:
    1. Understand you by their best even when you are way off beat
    1. Never correct your mistakes (I doubt it)
    1. Feed back their understanding of what you are saying
    1. Use words that you know (and teach you that you don't)
1. Copy the face. Get the muscles working right.
1. Direct connect. Don't try to translate. Just to feel, to imagine.
